# Uncommon HTML Form Submission Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to HTML form submission. The bug occurs when a button element is used within a form without specifying the `type` attribute correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.   The bug and its solution are illustrated using simple HTML code examples. 

## Bug Description
The bug involves a form with a button and a text input element. The default behavior of a button inside a form is to submit it. Without proper `type` attributes this could create unexpected behaviour and lead to unintended form submissions. 

## Solution
The solution involves correctly specifying the `type` attribute for the button element. By setting the type to "button", the default form submission behavior is prevented.  Alternative approaches are also presented and described.
