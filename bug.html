<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML error.  It involves using a <button> element incorrectly within a form.</p> <pre><code>&lt;form action="submit.php" method="post"> &lt;button type="submit">Submit&lt;/button> &lt;input type="text" name="username">&lt;/form> </code></pre> <p>The issue here is that the <button> element's default behavior is to submit the form, even though the form already has a submit button. If a JavaScript event handler is attached to the text input (e.g., for input validation), and the button is clicked, both the JavaScript event and the form submission will occur, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Or, if the user clicks the button before the text input is filled, it could be submitted empty.</p>
